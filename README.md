 Hi, I’m @serraq

 I'm an assistant professor in mechanics, lab Gabriel Lamé, INSA Centre Val de Loire, Bourges, France.
 
 My research topics are focused on numerical simulations in mechanics:
 * Numerical solvers for non standard mechanical systems : e.g. transient dynamics of viscoelastic materials using fractional derivatives
 * Propagating uncertainties in numerical simulations: what is the result when the input (geometry, material parameters) may vary ? Several methods exist, I work on Polynomial Chaos and try to improve this method, especially when the number of parameters is large.
 * Measuring the sensitivity of a simulation to input parameters
 * Parameteric optimization
 * Innovant solvers based on Artificial Intelligence for numerical simulations in mechanics : PINN
 * Inverse problems: identification of parameters

Applications may be academic cases, but I have a specific interest into vibroacoustics. The objective may be to reduce the sound, or to improve it if we consider musical instrument design.
